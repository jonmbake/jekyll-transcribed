**Wow!** This is *really* cool.  Now I can transcribe all my conversations easily for everyone to see.

It even supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) so I can easily transcribe links, lists:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third.

# And Headers, too!

**This is really cool!**  But I don't think we should publicly transcribe all our conversations.  We say some pretty crazy stuff.

Good point.
